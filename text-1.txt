This manual has been compiled by authors who have worked for a long time with students studying English as a second foreign language. The experience we have gained has helped us understand the main difficulties students face at both the elementary and advanced stages of learning.
Given the large number of course books currently available, it was quite difficult for the authors to choose a form of presenting the material that would be original yet effective.
Since we have always liked both the design and the way the material is presented in Raymond Murphy’s grammar book English Grammar in Use, we made an attempt to create a book which, in our opinion, is just as user-friendly, while taking into account the difficulties encountered by Russian-speaking learners.
When writing this manual, the authors set themselves the task of presenting English grammar in an accessible and concise way in order to systematize learners' knowledge.
The theoretical material is presented in Russian, which, from our point of view, makes the manual convenient for beginners, as it removes language difficulties when first becoming familiar with a topic and mastering the basic rules of forming and using grammatical structures. English spelling follows the British variety.
Some examples given in the theoretical section are accompanied by translations in order to emphasize the grammatical phenomena that are most difficult for Russian-speaking students.
Each lesson (Unit) includes sentences for translation from Russian into English. This type of work is especially important both for consolidating grammatical material and for activating vocabulary.
The lexical content of the exercises is aimed at learners who have mastered the most commonly used English vocabulary. The manual offered here cannot be used as a basic course book, but we hope it will prove useful and interesting as a supplement to any textbook or course.
In addition, it is quite clear that, despite the many different course books available, both teachers and learners often lack exercises of both a test format and translation exercises, and this manual can be used both in the classroom and at home for individual study.
The manual consists of 84 lessons grouped thematically into separate sections. The final lesson of each section is devoted to revision, which helps to check how well the material has been mastered.
The material selected by the authors for practice and consolidation is partly arranged according to the principle of increasing difficulty. Major sections such as tenses, passive forms, and articles, on the one hand, depend on one another; however, at an advanced stage of learning, more complex grammatical phenomena may be studied independently of simpler ones.
The material in other lessons does not depend on the previous ones, so the book can also be used as a reference. The manual is intended both as a grammar reference book and as a collection of exercises.
We hope that this manual will be useful for school pupils, students of colleges, lyceums, and universities, course participants, as well as for those who study English independently at different stages of learning.

How to Read Effectively. Reading is a complex skill. In our first languages, we employ a variety of micro-skills to help us read. For example, we might skim a particular passage in order to understand the general idea, or gist. Or we might scan through multiple pages of a train timetable looking for a particular time or place. While these micro-skills are second nature when reading in our first languages, when it comes to reading in a foreign language, research suggests that we often abandon most of these reading skills. In a foreign language, we usually start at the beginning of a text and try to understand every single word. Inevitably, we come across unknown or difficult words and quickly get frustrated with our lack of understanding.

One of the main benefits of reading in a foreign language is that you gain exposure to large amounts of words and expressions used naturally. This kind of reading for pleasure in order to learn a language is generally known as ‘extensive reading’. It is very different from reading a textbook in which dialogues or texts are meant to be read in detail with the aim of understanding every word. That kind of reading to reach specific learning aims or do tasks is referred to as ‘intensive reading’. To put it another way, the intensive reading in textbooks usually helps you with grammar rules and specific vocabulary, whereas reading stories extensively helps show you natural language in use.

While you may have started your language learning journey using only textbooks, Short Stories in English for Beginners will now provide you with opportunities to learn more about natural English language in use. Here are a few suggestions to keep in mind when reading the stories in this book in order to learn the most from them: • Enjoyment and a sense of achievement when reading is vitally important. Enjoying what you read keeps you coming back for more. The best way to enjoy reading stories and feel a sense of achievement is by reading each story from beginning to end. Consequently, reaching the end of a story is the most important thing. It is actually more important than understanding every word in it! • The more you read, the more you learn. By reading longer texts for enjoyment, you will quickly build up an understanding of how English works. But remember: in order to take full advantage of the benefits of extensive reading, you have to actually read a large enough volume in the first place. Reading a couple of pages here and there may teach you a few new words, but it won’t be enough to make a real impact on the overall level of your English.

You must accept that you won’t understand everything you read in a story. This is probably the most important point of all! Always remember that it is completely normal that you do not understand all the words or sentences. It doesn’t mean that your language level is flawed or that you are not doing well. It means you’re engaged in the process of learning. So, what should you do when you don’t understand a word? Here are a few steps: 1. Look at the word and see if it is familiar in any way. Remember to look for vocabulary elements from your first language that may be familiar. Take a guess – you might surprise yourself! 2. Re-read the sentence that contains the unknown word several times. Use the context of that sentence, and the rest of the story, to try to guess what the unknown word might mean.
3. Think about whether or not the word might be a different form of a word you know. For example, you might encounter a verb that you know, but it has been conjugated in a different or unfamiliar way. You may not be familiar with the particular form used, but ask yourself: Can I still understand the gist of what’s going on? Usually, if you have managed to recognize the main verb, that is enough. Instead of getting frustrated, simply notice how the verb is being used, and carry on reading. Recognizing different forms of words will come intuitively over time. 4. Make a note of the unknown word in a notebook and check the meaning later. You can review these words over time to make them part of your active vocabulary. If you simply must know the meaning of a bolded word, you can look it up in the vocabulary lists at the end of each chapter or in the glossary at the back of this book or use a dictionary. However, this should be your last resort. These suggestions are designed to train you to handle reading in English independently and without help. The more you can develop this skill, the better you’ll be able to read. Remember: learning to be comfortable with the ambiguity you may encounter while reading a foreign language is the most powerful skill that will help you become an independent and resilient learner of English!

The Six-Step Reading Process. In order to get the most from reading Short Stories in English for Beginners, it will be best for you to follow this simple six-step reading process for each chapter of the stories: 1 Look at the illustration and read the chapter title. Think about what the story might be about. Then read the chapter all the way through. Your aim is simply to reach the end of the chapter. Therefore, do not stop to look up words and do not worry if there are things you do not understand. Simply try to follow the plot. 2 When you reach the end of the chapter, read the short summary of the plot to see if you have understood what has happened. If you find this difficult, do not worry; you will improve with each chapter. 3 Go back and read the same chapter again. If you like, you can focus more on story details than before, but otherwise simply read it through one more time. 4  When you reach the end of the chapter for the second time, read the summary again and review the vocabulary list. If you are unsure about the meanings of any words in the vocabulary list, scan through the text to find them in the story and examine them in context. This will help you better understand the words. 5 Next, work through the comprehension questions to check your understanding of key events in the story. If you do not get them all correct, do not worry; simply answering the questions will help you better understand the story.
6  At this point, you should have some understanding of the main events of the chapter. If not, you may wish to re-read the chapter a few times using the vocabulary list to check unknown words and phrases until you feel confident. Once you are ready and confident that you understand what has happened – whether it’s after one reading of the chapter or several – move on to the next chapter and continue enjoying the story at your own pace, just as you would any other book. Only once you have completed a story in its entirety should you consider going back and studying the story language in more depth if you wish. Or, instead of worrying about understanding everything, take time to focus on all that you have understood and congratulate yourself for all that you have done so far. Remember: the biggest benefits you will derive from this book will come from reading story after story through from beginning to end. If you can do that, you will be on your way to reading effectively in English!
